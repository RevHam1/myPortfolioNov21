            critically. There is no plagiarism with this institute. Originality
            is the focus and giving credit to where credit is due is highly
            emphasized. This is one of the most critical degrees that I have
            earned. It not only challenged me how to think critically but also
            to faithfully live in a fallen word with integrity.
